Here’s a tight executive summary of McKinsey’s “The agentic organization: Contours of the next paradigm for the AI era”.

**Big idea** — We’re entering a paradigm where humans work side-by-side with virtual and physical AI agents at scale, reshaping how value is created. McKinsey calls this the *agentic organization*—a network of human–AI “teams” that can operate at near-zero marginal cost on many tasks. Early adopters are already reorganizing around this model.

**Why now** — AI’s task endurance and reliability are compounding fast (McKinsey cites evidence of steady increases), suggesting agents will handle longer, more complex work with decreasing supervision—potentially days of effort by 2027. Translation: today’s “AI intern” is growing up fast; get it a desk.

**Five pillars of the agentic organization** — Think of these as the “org chart” for your humans + agents Avengers team:

1. **Business model:** Build AI-native channels that deliver real-time, hyperpersonalized experiences and wrap them in a moat of proprietary data; expect revenue/employee to climb and costs to decouple from growth. (Yes, your chatbot might soon upsell better than your best rep.) 
2. **Operating model:** Redesign end-to-end workflows as AI-first, then re-insert humans where judgment, oversight, or empathy are essential; move toward flatter, outcome-aligned “agentic teams.” (Flatter orgs, fewer meetings; the dream.) 
3. **Governance:** Set guardrails for agent autonomy, risk, compliance, safety, monitoring, and auditability to prevent agent sprawl. (No rogue agents booking company retreats to Mars.) 
4. **Workforce, people, culture:** Prioritize talent with high-level cognitive skills, strong socio-emotional abilities, and an AI-first mindset; introduce new roles (e.g., agent designers, supervisors) and heavy upskilling. (Soft skills stay hard to automate—good news for humans.) 
5. **Technology & data:** Stand up robust data foundations and orchestration to deploy, observe, and scale heterogeneous agents across the enterprise. (Agents run on data; starve them and they get “hangry.”) 

**Illustrative examples** — A future bank uses a personal AI concierge to coordinate property search, underwriting, compliance, contracting, and loan fulfillment—humans supervise while agents do the heavy lifting. Utilities and automakers are deploying assistants and agent squads to cut handling times, modernize legacy systems, and speed product work. (Your mortgage process, but make it Formula 1.) 

**What leaders should do now** — Don’t wait for perfect clarity:

* Pick 2–3 high-value workflows and redesign them AI-first with measurable targets.
* Form small agentic teams (product + ops + risk + data) to ship in weeks, not quarters.
* Establish a lightweight but firm governance model for safety, security, and accountability.
* Invest in proprietary data quality and access; pilot AI-native customer channels.
* Launch a company-wide upskilling plan for AI literacy and agent supervision. (Crawl, walk, run… then let the agents sprint.) 

**Risks & cautions** — Unchecked agent autonomy, compliance failures, security/privacy issues, hallucinations, and tool sprawl can erode trust and ROI; success hinges as much on human adoption and culture as on tech. (Great tech with bad habits is just… expensive.) 

**Bottom line** — The competitive edge shifts to organizations that *operationalize* AI through agentic teams across business, ops, governance, talent, and tech. Start small, scale fast, and build the muscle to supervise and integrate agents—before your rivals’ agents start working overtime.
