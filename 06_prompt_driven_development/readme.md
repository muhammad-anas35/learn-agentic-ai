# [Spec Kit Plus Documentation](https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/tree/main/docs-plus)

For the most current documentation, patterns, and templates for building scalable multi-agent AI systems, visit the [Spec Kit Plus repository](https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/tree/main/docs-plus).

This resource provides everything you need to build Agentic Workflows and production-ready stacks faster using technologies like the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, A2A, Kubernetes, Dapr, and Ray. It is a a practical fork of github/spec-kit for spec-driven development of agentic AI systems. It provides patterns, templates, and reference projects for building scalable, distributed multi-agent apps with the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, A2A, and a cloud-native runtime stackâ€”Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr (Actors & Workflows), and Ray. Use it to define specs, spin up services, orchestrate agents, and ship production-ready stacks faster with guardrails and CI-friendly scaffolds
