For the most current documentation, patterns, and templates for building scalable multi-agent AI systems, visit the [Spec Kit Plus repository](https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/tree/main/docs-plus).

This resource provides everything you need to build Agentic Workflows and production-ready stacks faster using technologies like the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, A2A, Kubernetes, Dapr, and Ray. It treats key development artifacts—such as specs, architecture history, prompt history, tests, and automated evaluations—as first-class components.
