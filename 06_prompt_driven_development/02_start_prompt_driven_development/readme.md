# Setting Up AI-Enhanced Development Environments

This guide uses a budget-based toolkit while keeping the same Prompt‑Driven Development (PDD) method. 
1. At the free tier, you can start with two terminal tools: **Qwen Code (CLI)**—a coding agent with strong codebase exploration, git automation, and optional vision support; and **Gemini CLI**—a terminal‑native assistant with a larger context window that’s great for long prompts and scripts. 
2. For a professional editor experience, **Cursor Pro** provides an AI‑native IDE with Agent Mode, parallel agents, multi‑file awareness, and fast tab completion. 
3. For advanced automation and repo‑wide work, **GPT‑5 Codex** operates as a cloud agent that can run parallel tasks, propose PRs with tests/docs, and coordinate larger changes. Choose the tool that fits your budget and workflow; the disciplined loop remains the same: Spec → Plan → Prompt → Test/Evaluate → Refactor → Record → Review.

### Proposed Ideal Dual Setup for Python Development
In the fast-evolving landscape of AI-assisted coding, our ideal setup for Python developers is unequivocally this dual-environment powerhouse: We suggest using **VS Code paired with GPT-5 Codex** for project initialization—leveraging its unparalleled extensibility, vast extension ecosystem, and robust agentic workflows that excel in collaborative, large-scale projects—along with each iteration and major updates to handle complex refactoring and autonomous task execution. **Complement this seamlessly with standalone Cursor's native AI magic** for tab completions during code editing and code review, where you can swap in different LLMs other than ChatGPT 5 Codex (like Claude or custom models) for diverse perspectives and lightning-fast inline suggestions, including its exclusive tab completion for predictive multi-file edits. 

This **match made in heaven** isn't just additive; it's transformative, allowing you to **leverage Git-synced repos** for effortless switching—dive into VS Code for intricate debugging and team integrations one moment, then zip over to Cursor for rapid prototyping and flow-state bursts the next—ultimately delivering the **best of both worlds**: the familiarity and power of a battle-tested IDE with the intuitive, AI-first velocity that turns complex apps into effortless realities, boosting productivity without compromise and **potentially turning you into a 10x programmer**.

To align with your preference, let's switch to a Python-based project: **Build a simple CLI Todo List app**. This will involve creating a class-based structure for tasks, basic CRUD operations (add, view, edit, delete), and persistence using JSON file I/O. It's lightweight, tests AI features like code generation, refactoring, and debugging, and runs in the terminal without external deps beyond standard library (or optional `json` module). Use Python 3.13+ for modern features like type hints.

The goal: Set up both environments, clone a shared repo (e.g., via GitHub), and implement the app. Track metrics like time to complete features, AI suggestion quality, and ease of iteration. You can time yourself or log prompts used.

### Setup for VS Code with ChatGPT 5 Codex
VS Code with the Codex extension provides AI assistance via chat and agent mode, but note that **tab completion for inline AI suggestions is not a native feature here—it's more conversational or extension-dependent**. As of September 2025, Codex fully supports GPT-5 for agentic coding (e.g., parallel tasks, codebase chats). Here's the step-by-step setup:

1. **Install VS Code**:
   - Download the latest VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (stable build recommended for compatibility).
   - Install on your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Launch it.

2. **Install the Codex Extension**:
   - Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac).
   - Search for "Codex – OpenAI's coding agent" by OpenAI.
   - Click Install. This adds inline AI chat, autocomplete, and agent mode directly in the editor.
   - Restart VS Code if prompted.

3. **Authenticate and Configure**:
   - Sign in with your ChatGPT Plus/Pro account (required for GPT-5 access; ~$20/month). Go to the Codex sidebar (new icon on the left) and click "Sign In."
   - In Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,) > Search for "Codex" > Set Primary Model to "GPT-5-Codex" for coding-optimized responses.
   - Optional: Add your OpenAI API key in Settings > Codex > API Key for higher limits or CLI integration. Enable features like "Agent Mode" for autonomous tasks (e.g., "Refactor this class for better error handling").

4. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Open VS Code > File > Open Folder > Create a new folder called `todo-app-vscode`.
   - Open Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`) and run:
     ```
     python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - Initialize Git: `git init` and create a repo on GitHub for syncing.
   - Test AI: Create `todo.py` > Highlight the file > Right-click > "Ask Codex" > Prompt: "Generate a basic Todo class with add and list methods using JSON persistence."

5. **Development Tips**:
   - Use the Codex Chat sidebar for codebase-wide queries (e.g., "@codebase Add delete functionality").
   - For parallel tasks, enable Agent Mode to run multiple edits simultaneously.
   - Common extensions to pair: Python (by Microsoft) for linting, GitLens for version control.

This setup takes ~5-10 minutes and leverages VS Code's vast ecosystem for a familiar feel.

### Setup for Standalone Cursor
Cursor is a full AI-first IDE (forked from VS Code), so no extensions needed—AI is baked in, including **exclusive tab completion for accepting multi-line AI suggestions inline with a single Tab key press, which speeds up iterative coding significantly**. It supports GPT-5 via integrations and excels in seamless, predictive editing. Setup is even quicker in 2025 with one-click installs.

1. **Download and Install Cursor**:
   - Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/) and download the latest version (v0.45+ as of September 2025).
   - Install on your OS. It auto-detects VS Code settings for a smooth transition.

2. **Sign In and Configure Models**:
   - Launch Cursor and sign in with GitHub, Google, or email (free tier available; Pro ~$20/month for unlimited GPT-5).
   - Open Settings (Cmd+, or Ctrl+,) > Models > Select "GPT-5" as Primary (or "GPT-5-Codex" if available via OpenAI integration—add your API key under Custom API Keys).
   - Enable features like "Composer" for multi-file edits and "Inline AI" for real-time suggestions with tab completion.

3. **Set Up the Project**:
   - File > Open Folder > Create `todo-app-cursor` (or clone the same Git repo from VS Code for direct comparison).
   - In Terminal (Cmd+` or Ctrl+`): 
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - Test AI: Create `todo.py` > Cmd+I (or Ctrl+I) > Prompt: "Build a CLI Todo app with a class for tasks, CRUD ops, and JSON saving." Use Tab to accept and refine suggestions inline.

4. **Development Tips**:
   - Use @-mentions in chat (e.g., "@todo.py Add command-line interface with argparse") for context-aware edits—tab completion makes applying them effortless.
   - Composer mode shines for refactoring the entire app at once.
   - It imports VS Code extensions automatically, so add the Python extension from the VS Code setup.

This standalone setup is ready in ~3-5 minutes and feels more "AI-native" for rapid prototyping, especially with tab completion.

### Comparing Development on the Same Project
Once both are set up:

1. **Sync the Project**: Use Git to push/pull the same repo between `todo-app-vscode` and `todo-app-cursor`. Start with a blank `todo.py`.

2. **Key Tasks to Compare** (Time Each ~30-60 mins total):
   - **Feature 1: Basic Class** – Prompt AI to generate a Todo class with add/view. Compare suggestion speed/accuracy (Cursor's tab completion may feel snappier here).
   - **Feature 2: Edit & Delete** – Add methods with error handling. Test autocomplete and iteration.
   - **Feature 3: Persistence & CLI** – Integrate JSON I/O and argparse. Evaluate multi-file awareness (e.g., add `main.py`).
   - **Debugging**: Intentionally break code (e.g., invalid JSON) and fix via AI chat.

3. **What to Track**:
   | Metric              | VS Code + Codex                          | Standalone Cursor                       |
   |---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Setup Time**     | 5-10 mins (extension install)            | 3-5 mins (direct download)              |
   | **AI Integration** | Extension-based; great for custom extensions | Native; faster inline edits with exclusive tab completion |
   | **Autonomy**       | Strong agent mode for parallel tasks     | Composer for predictive multi-edits     |
   | **Learning Curve** | Familiar if you know VS Code             | Similar UI, but AI prompts feel more intuitive |
   | **Cost**           | ChatGPT Plus (~$20/mo)                   | Cursor Pro (~$20/mo); free tier limited |
   | **Best For**       | Heavy customization, large teams         | Solo devs, quick iterations (tab completion boosts flow) |

4. **Run and Iterate**: Develop in one, switch to the other, and note differences (e.g., Cursor might generate cleaner code faster via tab completion, while VS Code handles extensions better). Share your findings—e.g., via a GitHub README with screenshots/timings.

This dual setup lets you A/B test hands-on, but here's the real magic: **combining VS Code with Codex and standalone Cursor is the best of both worlds—a match made in heaven for Python developers**. You get VS Code's unbeatable extensibility and ecosystem for complex, team-oriented workflows, paired with Cursor's lightning-fast, AI-native tab completion and predictive editing for solo bursts of creativity. It's like having a Swiss Army knife (VS Code) and a laser scalpel (Cursor) in one toolkit—seamlessly switch via Git for ultimate productivity, whether you're debugging a stubborn JSON edge case or rapidly prototyping CLI features. If you hit snags (e.g., API limits), free tiers work for light use. Ready to dive in, or want tweaks to the project?
