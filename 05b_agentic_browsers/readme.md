# The Future of Web Browsing is Agentic

The future of web browsing is indeed **agentic**, a paradigm shift that moves the browser from a passive tool for human-driven navigation to an active, intelligent partner. This transformation is being driven by major tech companies and innovative startups alike, all of whom are working to create a web where AI agents can perceive, reason, and act on a user's behalf.

This report synthesizes the key research conducted, covering the different approaches being taken, the critical technologies enabling them, and the emerging standards that will shape this new era.

You are absolutely right. My previous report was incomplete without including a crucial player like Fellou. My apologies for that oversight. A comprehensive overview of the agentic browsing landscape must include those who are pioneering the field.

### 1\. The Core Concept: From Browsing to "Agenting"

The central idea of **agentic browsing** is a fundamental change in human-computer interaction. It moves the browser from a passive tool for human-driven navigation to an active, intelligent partner. Instead of a user manually navigating with clicks, scrolls, and keystrokes, they provide a high-level goal in natural language (e.g., "Find me a weekend trip to Tokyo and book the flights"). An in-browser agent then takes over, executing a multi-step plan to achieve that goal. This involves:

  * **Understanding and Planning:** The agent deconstructs a complex request into a series of actionable steps.
  * **Perception:** It "sees" the web page through a visual or programmatic lens, understanding elements like buttons, forms, and links.
  * **Action:** It performs the necessary actions like clicking, typing, and navigating to new pages.
  * **Reasoning:** It can self-correct when it encounters an error or an unexpected pop-up, demonstrating a level of intelligence far beyond simple automation.

This shift promises to make the web more efficient, personalized, and accessible for everyone.

### 2\. The Players and Their Approaches

The development of agentic browsers is happening across two main fronts:

#### Established Browsers (Chrome, Edge)

These players are integrating agentic features into their existing, widely-used browsers. Their approach is iterative, starting with basic conversational AI and gradually adding more complex capabilities.

  * **Google Chrome (with Gemini):** Google is rapidly integrating its **Gemini** model into Chrome. While the initial features focus on conversational search and summarization, their roadmap includes **agentic capabilities** for tasks like booking appointments or ordering groceries. Google's advantage lies in its vast ecosystem, allowing an agent to seamlessly work across Google services like Maps, Gmail, and the search engine itself.
  * **Microsoft Edge (with Copilot):** Similarly, Microsoft is leveraging its **Copilot** assistant to make browsing more proactive. Copilot is deeply integrated with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, allowing it to assist with writing tasks, emails, and document creation, turning the browser into a powerful productivity hub.

#### AI-First Browsers (Fellou, Dia, Perplexity, OpenAI)

These are startups and projects that are building browsers from the ground up with AI agents at their core. Their architecture is designed for agentic workflows, often leading to more advanced and transparent agent capabilities.

  * **Fellou:** Positioned as the world's first "agentic browser," Fellou focuses on automating complex workflows across the web and even local files. It offers a **no-code/low-code** approach with its open-source **Eko 2.0 framework**, allowing users and developers to build custom agents. Its key features include a **"Shadow Workspace"** that runs tasks in the background and a **"Deep Action"** capability that turns natural language commands into multi-step workflows.
  * **Dia (The Browser Company):** As an "AI-first" browser, Dia is a conversational companion that lives in the URL bar. It's designed to adapt to a user's writing style, remember their preferences, and perform tasks across multiple tabs. A key feature is its **"Skills" framework**, which allows users to create personalized AI workflows using a low-code approach, making it an ideal tool for content creators and researchers.
  * **Perplexity Comet:** Perplexity has built Comet on the Chromium open-source project, making it feel familiar to Chrome users. Comet's primary focus is as a **personal AI assistant** that automates routine online tasks. It can manage multiple tabs, summarize emails, review calendar events, and even navigate web pages to perform tasks like comparing products across different retailers or booking meetings. Its core functionality is its **AI assistant,** which is always available in a sidebar and can execute multi-step workflows.
  * **OpenAI's Browser:** OpenAI is reportedly preparing to launch its own standalone browser to challenge Google Chrome's dominance. This browser will be built to give users a way to navigate the web beyond traditional link-based browsing. Its AI agents, such as **Operator**, will be able to complete user tasks directly within the browser, handling things like submitting forms, finding hotels, or comparing prices. This move is strategic, as it would give OpenAI direct access to user data without relying on third-party agreements with existing browser providers.

### 3\. The APIs and Standards Driving the Future

The shift to agentic browsing requires a standardized way for AI agents to interact with the web. This is where APIs and emerging standards are crucial.

  * **The Model Context Protocol (MCP):** This is the most significant development in the space. Introduced by Anthropic and rapidly adopted by Google and OpenAI, MCP is an open-source standard that gives AI models a universal "language" to interact with external tools and data sources. It is the foundational layer that allows an agent to "see" and "act" on a web page, and it is a strong candidate for a future universal standard.
  * **Browser Automation APIs:** Existing frameworks like **Puppeteer** and **Selenium** provide the low-level APIs for controlling a browser. While not built for AI, they serve as the foundation for agent-building platforms like AgentGPT, which layer an LLM's reasoning on top of these tools to create intelligent workflows.
  * **Developer SDKs:** Both OpenAI and Google are working on in-browser SDKs for their respective AI platforms. You can expect to see developer tools that allow you to build custom, fine-tuned agents that run directly within the browser, leveraging the models of **ChatGPT** and **Gemini**.

The future is one where the browser's functionality is no longer hard-coded but is instead a programmable, dynamic environment driven by user-created agents. This moves the web from a collection of static pages to a "dynamic environment of action" and "delegated autonomy."
